<h4>Faber Residence: Exclusive VVIP Pricing and Detailed Price List</h4><br>
<p>Faber Residence stands as a pinnacle of luxury living in Singapore, offering an exclusive collection of premium residences nestled within the verdant hillside of the prestigious Faber area. This exceptional development combines architectural excellence with an unparalleled location, providing residents with a harmonious blend of natural tranquility and urban convenience. The exclusive VVIP pricing structure has been thoughtfully designed to offer exceptional value for discerning buyers seeking a prestigious address that promises both lifestyle enhancement and investment potential. With a limited collection of meticulously crafted units available, the VVIP pricing presents a rare opportunity to secure a residence in one of Singapore's most sought-after developments before public launch, ensuring the most favorable terms and priority selection of premium units with optimal views and orientations.</p><br>

<p>The <a href="https://www.faber-residences.sg/">Faber Residence</a> price list reflects the development's commitment to delivering exceptional quality across various unit configurations, catering to different lifestyle needs while maintaining the highest standards of luxury throughout. From elegant two-bedroom apartments ideal for young professionals or investors, to spacious four-bedroom units designed for families seeking generous living spaces, each residence category has been thoughtfully priced to reflect its unique attributes while remaining competitive within Singapore's luxury property market. The price list also highlights the special premium applied to units with exceptional features such as private lift lobbies, unobstructed panoramic views, or expansive outdoor terraces, allowing potential buyers to clearly understand the value proposition of each available option and make informed decisions aligned with their preferences and requirements.</p><br>

<p>What sets Faber Residence apart from other luxury developments is its thoughtful integration of premium specifications and finishes as standard features rather than costly upgrades, ensuring that the published price list represents genuine value with minimal hidden costs. Each residence comes equipped with imported marble flooring in living areas, premium European kitchen appliances from brands like Miele or V-ZUG, smart home automation systems, and bathroom fixtures from renowned manufacturers such as Duravit and Hansgrohe. This commitment to quality extends to the carefully selected materials used throughout each home, from the engineered timber flooring in bedrooms to the custom cabinetry crafted from sustainable sources, ensuring that residents enjoy not only aesthetic beauty but also lasting durability and environmental responsibility.</p><br>

<p>The VVIP pricing structure for Faber Residence includes several exclusive benefits designed to enhance the ownership experience from the outset. Early buyers accessing the VVIP price list can enjoy preferential pricing that represents significant value compared to the eventual public launch prices, with savings that acknowledge their commitment and foresight. Additionally, VVIP buyers receive complimentary upgrade packages that would otherwise represent substantial additional investment, such as enhanced smart home features, premium appliance upgrades, or custom wardrobe systems. The developer has also arranged special financing packages in partnership with major banks, offering VVIP clients preferential interest rates and favorable loan terms that further enhance the attractiveness of the investment opportunity.</p><br>

<p>Understanding that luxury property purchases represent significant financial decisions, Faber Residence offers VVIP clients a comprehensive consultation process that goes beyond simply presenting the price list. Prospective buyers are invited to private sessions with the development team, including architects, interior designers, and financial advisors who can provide detailed insights into the property's design philosophy, construction quality, and investment potential. These consultations include personalized financial modeling that illustrates various payment schedules, potential rental yields, and long-term appreciation scenarios, empowering buyers to make decisions aligned with their financial goals and investment strategies. This bespoke approach ensures that each client receives the information and guidance relevant to their specific situation, rather than a one-size-fits-all sales presentation.</p><br>

<p>The detailed price list for Faber Residence also highlights the exceptional value represented by the development's extensive facilities and amenities, which have been designed to provide a resort-like living experience without additional membership fees or charges. Residents enjoy exclusive access to a comprehensive suite of lifestyle facilities including an infinity-edge swimming pool overlooking the lush hillside, a fully-equipped fitness center with the latest exercise technology, landscaped gardens with meditation pavilions, a clubhouse with entertainment lounges, and dedicated children's play areas. The maintenance fees have been carefully structured to ensure these premium amenities remain well-maintained while keeping ongoing costs reasonable for residents, representing another aspect of the development's commitment to delivering genuine value beyond the initial purchase price.</p>

<h4>Premium Unit Types and Floor Plans</h4><br>
<p>Faber Residence offers an exceptional range of unit types and floor plans, each meticulously designed to maximize space, functionality, and the stunning hillside views that define this prestigious development. The thoughtful variety ensures that prospective buyers can find a home that perfectly aligns with their lifestyle needs, family size, and investment objectives. Starting with the two-bedroom units, which range from approximately 700 to 850 square feet, these efficiently designed residences feature open-concept living areas that create an impression of spaciousness despite their compact footprint. Clever storage solutions, including built-in wardrobes and multifunctional furniture niches, demonstrate how these units can comfortably accommodate young professionals, couples, or investors seeking rental yield from Singapore's robust leasing market for quality properties in prime locations.</p><br>

<p>Moving up in size, the three-bedroom units at Faber Residence offer between 1,100 and 1,300 square feet of thoughtfully organized space. These apartments come in several configurations, including standard layouts with bedrooms positioned for optimal privacy, and premium corner units that benefit from dual aspect views and increased natural light. The master bedrooms in these units feature en-suite bathrooms with premium fittings and walk-in wardrobes, while the secondary bedrooms are versatile spaces that can function as guest accommodations, home offices, or hobby rooms. The showflat demonstrates how these three-bedroom units can be styled to appeal to small families, professionals working from home, or empty nesters downsizing from larger properties without sacrificing comfort or convenience.</p><br>

<p>For families requiring more space, Faber Residence offers four-bedroom units ranging from 1,500 to 1,800 square feet. These generously proportioned apartments feature expanded living and dining areas capable of accommodating family gatherings and entertaining. The kitchens in these units are upgraded to include larger islands, additional storage, and premium appliance packages suited to more extensive cooking and dining requirements. The master suites become more luxurious at this tier, with larger bathrooms featuring both shower enclosures and soaking tubs, while secondary bedrooms remain comfortable and well-appointed. Many of the four-bedroom units include dedicated utility spaces for laundry and storage, as well as helper's quarters in selected floor plans, addressing the practical needs of family living in Singapore's context.</p><br>

<p>The premium tier of Faber Residence comprises exclusive penthouses, ranging from 2,000 to over 2,500 square feet. These exceptional homes occupy the highest floors of the development, offering unparalleled panoramic views of the surrounding greenery and city skyline beyond. Their floor plans feature clear separations between public and private spaces, with formal living and dining areas complemented by family rooms or studies that offer more casual gathering spaces. Master suites in these penthouses are truly retreats, with expanded bathrooms, generous dressing areas, and in some cases, private terraces. Guest suites with en-suite bathrooms ensure comfortable accommodation for visitors or multi-generational families. The kitchens in these premium units are designed for serious cooking and entertaining, with professional-grade appliances, extensive counter space, and in some floor plans, separate wet kitchens for Asian cooking styles.</p><br>

<p>A distinctive feature of Faber Residence's floor plans is the thoughtful integration of outdoor spaces across all unit types. From modest balconies in the two-bedroom apartments to expansive terraces in the penthouses, these outdoor extensions of the living space are designed to maximize the hillside experience and stunning views. The showflat demonstrates how these areas can be furnished as outdoor living rooms, dining spaces, or urban gardens, creating seamless indoor-outdoor flow that enhances the overall living experience. Corner units benefit from wrap-around balconies that provide different perspectives on the surrounding environment, while selected ground-floor units feature private gardens that offer a rare opportunity for ground-level outdoor space in urban Singapore.</p><br>

<p>Beyond showcasing the various unit types, the Faber Residence sales gallery provides comprehensive information about the flexibility and customization options available to buyers. Interactive displays allow visitors to explore different layout possibilities, finish selections, and upgrade packages. The sales team can explain how certain non-structural walls can be modified or removed to create more personalized spaces, such as combining two bedrooms into a larger master suite or opening a kitchen fully to the living area. This transparency about customization options helps potential buyers envision not just the show units as presented, but how their own Faber Residence home could be tailored to their specific needs and preferences, making the transition from visitor to satisfied resident a seamless journey guided by informed choices and clear expectations.</p>

<h4>VVIP Pricing Benefits and Exclusive Offers</h4><br>
<p>The VVIP pricing structure at Faber Residence represents a significant advantage for early investors and serious buyers, offering substantial financial benefits that extend well beyond mere price discounts. As part of the developer's strategy to reward early commitment, VVIP pricing typically includes direct savings of between 5-8% compared to public launch prices, translating to substantial five to six-figure savings depending on the unit type selected. This preferential pricing acknowledges the confidence shown by early buyers and compensates them for their foresight in securing units before the development gains wider market recognition. The tiered VVIP pricing system further rewards buyers who make decisions promptly during the priority selection period, with the most attractive prices available to those who commit earliest, creating a compelling incentive for decisive action.</p><br>

<p>Beyond the direct price advantages, Faber Residence offers VVIP buyers an impressive package of financial incentives designed to enhance affordability and investment returns. These typically include partial absorption of stamp duties, which can represent significant savings in Singapore's property tax environment. Additionally, VVIP buyers benefit from flexible payment schedules tailored to optimize cash flow, including extended booking fee periods, staggered payment milestones aligned with construction progress, and in some cases, interest absorption schemes during the construction period. The developer has also negotiated special financing packages with partner banks, offering VVIP clients preferential interest rates, higher loan-to-value ratios where applicable, and reduced administrative fees, further enhancing the overall value proposition.</p><br>

<p>The exclusive benefits extended to VVIP buyers at Faber Residence go beyond financial considerations to include significant quality-of-life enhancements through complimentary upgrades and customization options. These typically include premium finishing packages that would otherwise represent substantial additional investments, such as upgraded marble flooring, enhanced smart home systems, premium kitchen appliance upgrades, or custom wardrobe systems. VVIP buyers also enjoy priority access to limited customization opportunities, allowing them to personalize aspects of their residences before construction progresses too far, including options for alternative color schemes, kitchen configurations, or bathroom fittings that aren't available to later purchasers.</p><br>

<p>The VVIP experience at Faber Residence extends to exceptional service privileges that begin during the purchase process and continue throughout ownership. Early buyers receive dedicated relationship managers who provide personalized attention throughout the purchase journey and beyond, ensuring smooth communication and prompt resolution of any queries. VVIP clients also receive priority for appointment scheduling, with flexible viewing times outside standard hours and exclusive access to the showflat before public launch crowds. After completion, these buyers continue to receive preferential treatment through priority handling of any defect rectification requests during the warranty period, dedicated move-in coordination services, and in some cases, complimentary interior design consultations to help them realize their vision for their new home.</p><br>

<p>For investors considering Faber Residence as an investment opportunity, the VVIP package includes valuable services designed to maximize returns and minimize hassle. These typically include complimentary rental valuation services, preferential rates with recommended property management companies, and introductions to reliable tenants seeking premium accommodations. The developer may also offer guaranteed rental programs for selected periods, providing income security during the initial ownership phase. Additionally, VVIP investors receive priority access to investment seminars and market updates organized by the developer and partner agencies, ensuring they remain well-informed about factors affecting their investment's performance and potential exit strategies as the property market evolves.</p><br>

<p>Perhaps most valuable of all, the VVIP pricing and benefits package at Faber Residence includes priority unit selection privileges that allow early buyers to secure the most desirable units before they become available to the general public. This advantage cannot be overstated in a development where factors such as floor level, orientation, view corridors, and proximity to amenities can significantly impact both lifestyle enjoyment and long-term appreciation potential. VVIP buyers can select from the full inventory during their priority booking period, ensuring access to premium corner units, higher floors with panoramic views, or residences with unique features such as larger terraces or private lift lobbies. This priority selection opportunity represents a tangible benefit that extends well beyond the immediate financial advantages, securing for VVIP buyers the best possible living experience and investment potential within this exceptional development.</p>
